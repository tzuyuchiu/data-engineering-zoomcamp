# Module 1 Homework: Docker & SQL

In this homework we'll prepare the environment and practice
Docker and SQL

When submitting your homework, you will also need to include
a link to your GitHub repository or other public code-hosting
site.

This repository should contain the code for solving the homework. 

When your solution has SQL or shell commands and not code
(e.g. python files) file format, include them directly in
the README file of your repository.


## Question 1. Understanding docker first run 

Run docker with the `python:3.12.8` image in an interactive mode, use the entrypoint `bash`.

What's the version of `pip` in the image?

- 24.3.1
- 24.2.1
- 23.3.1
- 23.2.1

#### Solution:
- 24.3.1
```
docker run -it python:3.12.8 bash
pip --version
```
## Question 2. Understanding Docker networking and docker-compose

Given the following `docker-compose.yaml`, what is the `hostname` and `port` that **pgadmin** should use to connect to the postgres database?

```yaml
services:
  db:
    container_name: postgres
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_DB: 'ny_taxi'
    ports:
      - '5433:5432'
    volumes:
      - vol-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: "pgadmin@pgadmin.com"
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "pgadmin"
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - vol-pgadmin_data:/var/lib/pgadmin  

volumes:
  vol-pgdata:
    name: vol-pgdata
  vol-pgadmin_data:
    name: vol-pgadmin_data
```

- postgres:5433
- localhost:5432
- db:5433
- postgres:5432
- db:5432
  
#### Solution:
- localhost:5432


##  Prepare Postgres

Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos
We'll use the green taxi trips from October 2019:

```bash
wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-10.csv.gz
```

You will also need the dataset with zones:

```bash
wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/misc/taxi_zone_lookup.csv
```

Download this data and put it into Postgres.

You can use the code from the course. It's up to you whether
you want to use Jupyter or a python script.

## Question 3. Trip Segmentation Count

During the period of October 1st 2019 (inclusive) and November 1st 2019 (exclusive), how many trips, **respectively**, happened:
1. Up to 1 mile
2. In between 1 (exclusive) and 3 miles (inclusive),
3. In between 3 (exclusive) and 7 miles (inclusive),
4. In between 7 (exclusive) and 10 miles (inclusive),
5. Over 10 miles 

Answers:

- 104,802;  197,670;  110,612;  27,831;  35,281
- 104,802;  198,924;  109,603;  27,678;  35,189
- 104,793;  201,407;  110,612;  27,831;  35,281
- 104,793;  202,661;  109,603;  27,678;  35,189
- 104,838;  199,013;  109,645;  27,688;  35,202

1.
```
SELECT
  COUNT(1)
FROM
  green_taxi_trips
WHERE trip_distance <=1;
```
2.
```
SELECT
  COUNT(1)
FROM
  green_taxi_trips
WHERE (trip_distance >1 AND trip_distance <=3);
```
3.
```
SELECT
  COUNT(1)
FROM
  green_taxi_trips
WHERE (trip_distance >3 AND trip_distance <=7);
```
4.
```
SELECT
  COUNT(1)
FROM
  green_taxi_trips
WHERE (trip_distance >7 AND trip_distance <=10);
```
5.
```
SELECT
  COUNT(1)
FROM
  green_taxi_trips
WHERE trip_distance > 10;
```
#### Solution:
- 104,838;  199,013;  109,645;  27,688;  35,202

## Question 4. Longest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance?
Use the pick up time for your calculations.

Tip: For every day, we only care about one single trip with the longest distance. 

- 2019-10-11
- 2019-10-24
- 2019-10-26
- 2019-10-31

#### Solution:
- 2019-10-31
```
SELECT
  date(lpep_pickup_datetime),
  MAX(trip_distance) AS longest_D
FROM
  green_taxi_trips
GROUP BY date(lpep_pickup_datetime)
ORDER BY longest_D DESC;
```
## Question 5. Three biggest pickup zones

Which were the top pickup locations with over 13,000 in
`total_amount` (across all trips) for 2019-10-18?

Consider only `lpep_pickup_datetime` when filtering by date.
 
- East Harlem North, East Harlem South, Morningside Heights
- East Harlem North, Morningside Heights
- Morningside Heights, Astoria Park, East Harlem South
- Bedford, East Harlem North, Astoria Park

#### Solution:
- East Harlem North, East Harlem South, Morningside Heights
```
SELECT
  CONCAT(zpu."Borough",'/',zpu."Zone") AS "pickup_loc",
  SUM(g.total_amount)
FROM
  green_taxi_trips g JOIN zones zpu
  ON g."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
WHERE date(g.lpep_pickup_datetime) ='2019-10-18'
GROUP BY pickup_loc
ORDER BY SUM(g.total_amount) DESC;
```
## Question 6. Largest tip

For the passengers picked up in October 2019 in the zone
name "East Harlem North" which was the drop off zone that had
the largest tip?

Note: it's `tip` , not `trip`

We need the name of the zone, not the ID.

- Yorkville West
- JFK Airport
- East Harlem North
- East Harlem South
  
#### Solution:
- JFK Airport
```
SELECT
  zpu."Zone" AS "pickup_loc",
  zdo."Zone" AS "dropoff_loc",
  MAX(g.tip_amount)
FROM
  green_taxi_trips g JOIN zones zpu
  ON g."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
  JOIN zones zdo
  ON g."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
WHERE zpu."Zone" ='East Harlem North'
GROUP BY zpu."Zone",zdo."Zone"
ORDER BY MAX(g.tip_amount) DESC;
```
  
## Terraform

In this section homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.

In your VM on GCP/Laptop/GitHub Codespace install Terraform. 
Copy the files from the course repo
[here](../../../01-docker-terraform/1_terraform_gcp/terraform) to your VM/Laptop/GitHub Codespace.

Modify the files as necessary to create a GCP Bucket and Big Query Dataset.

####Solution:
```
(base) ➜  terraform_with_variables git:(main) ✗ terraform init
Initializing the backend...
Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding hashicorp/google versions matching "6.16.0"...
- Installing hashicorp/google v6.16.0...
- Installed hashicorp/google v6.16.0 (signed by HashiCorp)
Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

(base) ➜  terraform_with_variables git:(main) ✗ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

## Question 7. Terraform Workflow

Which of the following sequences, **respectively**, describes the workflow for: 
1. Downloading the provider plugins and setting up backend,
2. Generating proposed changes and auto-executing the plan
3. Remove all resources managed by terraform`

Answers:
- terraform import, terraform apply -y, terraform destroy
- teraform init, terraform plan -auto-apply, terraform rm
- terraform init, terraform run -auto-approve, terraform destroy
- terraform init, terraform apply -auto-approve, terraform destroy
- terraform import, terraform apply -y, terraform rm

#### Solution:
- terraform init, terraform apply -auto-approve, terraform destroy
